# Welcome

*This is bare bones right now*

In godot editor, try opening these scenes and poke around: 

* res://Source/Levels/level_01.tscn
* res://Source/Player/player.tscn

In godot editor or your text editor of choice, take a look at `res://Source/Player/player.gd`. This script is attached to the root node `player.tscn`. Try editing `speed` and `jump_velocity` variables, saving, then relaunching the game.
